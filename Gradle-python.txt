you can integrate Python code into a Gradle build process, though Gradle is primarily designed for JVM-based languages like Java.
There are different approaches to include Python scripts in your Gradle workflow, such as:

1. Using Gradle's Exec Task
Gradle's Exec task allows you to execute external commands, including Python scripts. Y
ou can define tasks in your build.gradle file to run Python scripts as part of your build process.

Here's an example:

In gradle:

task runPythonScript(type: Exec) {
    commandLine 'python', 'path/to/your_script.py'
}
This task will execute your Python script using the command python path/to/your_script.py.

2. Using the Python Plugin for Gradle
There is a community Gradle plugin called PyGradle that provides better support for Python projects. It allows you to manage Python dependencies, package Python code, and more, much like Gradle works with Java.

To use it:

Add the Python plugin in your build.gradle:
In gradle:

plugins {
    id 'com.linkedin.python' version '0.9.10' // Replace with the latest version
}
Configure your Python environment and dependencies. For example:
In gradle :

python {
    pythonBinary = '/usr/bin/python3' // Path to your Python binary
    pypi {
        repositories {
            // Add your Python package repositories
        }
        dependencies {
            'numpy'  // Example of adding a Python dependency
        }
    }
}
Build your Python project using:
bash

gradle buildPython
3. Custom Scripts in Gradle
You can also integrate Python as part of a custom workflow by defining your own tasks in Gradle, depending on your build pipeline.

For example:

In gradle:

task runPythonScript {
    doLast {
        println 'Running Python Script...'
        def result = 'python path/to/your_script.py'.execute().text
        println result
    }
}
When to Use Gradle with Python
Hybrid Projects: If your project involves both Java (or Android) and Python components, integrating them under a single Gradle build can help streamline the process.
Automated Build and Test: Gradleâ€™s task-based system can manage testing, linting, and deploying your Python code, especially in projects that mix Python with other languages.
