Git Checkout -it is used for switching different branches.

Git branch <branch name> -- Creating a new branch.
Git pull -- getting updated code from repo
git merge <branch name> - merging different branches.
git branch -d <branch name> - Deleting specific branch.

By using git fetch the changes will not reflect into local branch we need to merge those changes manually 
But By using git pull the changes will directly reflects inside our local branch.
Git rebase : git rebase gives you a clean history by avoiding merge commits.
It "rebases" or moves your commits on top of another branch.
