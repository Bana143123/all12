Regex :

It can be used to check if a string contains specified search pattern.

There are different types of RegEx Functions:

1.findall  - it returns a list containing the matching items.
2.search   - it returns a match object if there is a match anywhere in the string.
3.split    - it returns a list where the string has been split at each match.
4.sub      - it replaces one or many matches with a string.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In RegEx we have different Metacharacters.
[] - A set of characters.
\  - It signals a special sequence.
.  - Any Character.
^  - Starts with.
$  - Ends with.
*  - Zero or more occurances.
+  - One or more occurances.
?  - Zero or one occurances.
{} - Exactly specified number of occurances.
|  - Either or.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Sequences : A special sequence is a \ folowed by one of character as below.
\A - Returns a match if the specified characters are at the beginning of the string. Ex:"\AThe"
\b - Returns a match where the specified characters are at the beginning or at the end of a word Ex:r"\bain" , r"ain\b".
\B - Returns a match where the specified characters are present, but NOT at the beginning (or at the end) of a word. Ex:r"\Bain" , r"ain\B".
\d - Returns a match where the string contains digits (numbers from 0-9).
\D - Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain digits.
\s - Returns a match where the string contains a white space character.
\S - Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain a white space character.
\w - Returns a match where the string contains any word characters (characters from a to Z, digits from 0-9, and the underscore _ character).
\W - Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain any word characters.
\Z - Returns a match if the specified characters are at the end of the string.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sets : A set is a set of characters inside a pair of square brackets [] with a special meaning.
[arn] 	   - Returns a match where one of the specified characters (a, r, or n) is present.
[a-n] 	   - Returns a match for any lower case character, alphabetically between a and n.
[^arn]	   - Returns a match for any character EXCEPT a, r, and n.
[0123]	   - Returns a match where any of the specified digits (0, 1, 2, or 3) are present.
[0-9] 	   - Returns a match for any digit between 0 and 9.
[0-5][0-9] - Returns a match for any two-digit numbers from 00 and 59.
[a-zA-Z]   - Returns a match for any character alphabetically between a and z, lower case OR upper case.
[+]	   - In sets, +, *, ., |, (), $,{} has no special meaning, so [+] means: return a match for any + character in the string.
