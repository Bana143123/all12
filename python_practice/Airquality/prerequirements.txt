Step 1: Set Up Your Hardware
1.1 Components Required:
ESP32 microcontroller
DHT22 sensor (for temperature and humidity)
Connecting wires
Breadboard (optional)
1.2 Connect the DHT22 Sensor to the ESP32:
Connect the VCC pin of the DHT22 to the 3.3V pin of the ESP32.
Connect the GND pin of the DHT22 to the GND pin of the ESP32.
Connect the Data pin of the DHT22 to GPIO 4 (or any other available GPIO pin) on the ESP32.
Step 2: Install MicroPython on ESP32
2.1 Install the ESP32 Board Support Package:
Download and install esptool.py.
Download the latest MicroPython firmware for ESP32 
2.2 Connect to ESP32 Using a Serial Terminal:
Use a serial terminal (like PuTTY or screen) to connect to the ESP32. The baud rate is typically 115200.
