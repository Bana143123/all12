Variables: Variables are like a container to store the data.
variables can have digits(except at first position),can have characters, can have special symbols($,_(underscore)).
-->it was good practice to respresent variables using camescase(ex: userName)
we are declaring variables by using keywords.
we have different keywords in js 
1.let
2.const
3.var

const -- This keyword will be used, when the variable value can't be changed further.
ex: pi=3.14(pi value always same)

History of javascript:
In 1990's we don't have js to create dynamic webpages, Those days webpages created in static way.
So Netscpe communication corporation limited decided to creates a own programming language with help of bredan Eich who was working in that organisation.
He Creates a new programming language in just 10 days.
Initially That language named as Mocha, While launching They renamed as "LiveScript".
Netscape decided to market this new programming language so again they renamed as Javascript because those days java was trending programming language.
They are trying to attract users with this name to buy this Javascript language.
